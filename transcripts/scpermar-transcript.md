### The Open-Source Datascience Masters 

### scpermar transcript draft 

Grad school is not a practical option based on current family demands. Online sources will allow me to learn with a faster feedback loop to gage my aptitude and enthusiasm for D.S. as a career evolution path.

### My Background ([linkedin](http://))

Earned a BS CS at The University of Pittsburgh some time ago ... B4Y2k. Worked as java client-server dev in all parts of the SDLC with the dominate experience investigating problems from a data perspective using Oracle SQL-PL/SQL.

### Motivations of the Open Source D.S.

Data Science is an ideal combination of my experience with solving code related problems through data analysis, a fascination with understanding how everything works and an ability to visualize ideas from many perspectives including the communication skills to explain these ideas to others. 

### Goals
* Apply more rigorous statistical methods to my current data analysis professional projects. (Department level metrics etc.)
* Develop a presence in open source or data based competitions such as Kaggle to build demonstrable experience.
* Build enough knowledge and experience on my own to move to a data science focused team and continue down the path toward becoming a data scientist.

### Next Steps?

Plan a curriculum to build a solid understanding of the fundamental DS concepts.

### A Note on Tools

This degree is brought to you by: "THE INTERNET". 

Information is more democratized^ now than it was at any point in history. Given a little initiative and interest, you can tailor and excel in an education of your own design. The connective web made me what I am today, growing from the child obsessed with [Number Munchers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Munchers#Number_Munchers) to an adult jaw-dropping over [DBSCAN](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN).

The most valuable resources I used were:
* [Coursera](http://coursera.org)
* [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability/random-variables-topic/random_variables_prob_dist/v/term-life-insurance-and-death-probability)
* [Wolfram Alpha](http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=torus)
* [Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases)
* [Quora](http://www.quora.com/Programming-Challenges-1/What-are-some-good-toy-problems-in-data-science)
* **Kindle .mobis** (carrying textbooks is so 90s.)
* PopSci Read: [The Signal and The Noise](http://www.amazon.com/Signal-Noise-Predictions-Fail-but-ebook/dp/B007V65R54/ref=tmm_kin_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&sr=8-1&qid=1376699450) Nate Silver
* **Friends & Family** (Impossible without their support! Special Thanks to N.S.)

*^ given internet access - an issue near and dear to me.*
