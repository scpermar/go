### The Open-Source Datascience Masters 

### scpermar transcript draft 

Grad school is not a practical option based on current family demands. Online sources will allow me to learn with a faster feedback loop to gage my aptitude and enthusiasm for D.S. as a career evolution path.

### My Background ([linkedin](http://))

Earned a BS CS at The University of Pittsburgh some time ago ... B4Y2k. Worked as java client-server dev in all parts of the SDLC with the dominate experience investigating software problems from a data perspective using Oracle SQL-PL/SQL.

### Motivations of the Open Source D.S.

Data Science is an ideal combination of my experience with solving code related problems through data analysis, a fascination with understanding how everything works and an ability to visualize ideas from many perspectives including the communication skills to explain these ideas to others. 

### Goals
* Apply more rigorous statistical methods to my current data analysis professional projects. (Department level metrics etc.)
* Develop a presence in open source or data based competitions such as Kaggle to build demonstrable experience.
* Build enough knowledge and experience on my own to move to a data science focused team and continue down the path toward becoming a data scientist.

### Next Steps?

Plan a curriculum to build a solid understanding of the fundamental DS concepts.

## Curriculum
